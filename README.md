## Description
For this assignment I have converted one of my previous projects to make it render its most important content from the server. The page consists of an overview page with video's that can be opened to show the youtube player. The content and detail view can all be rendered without client-side Javascript. With Javascript turned on, other features are available such as adding video's to the page. Unfortunately I was unable to recreate this feature Server-side.
